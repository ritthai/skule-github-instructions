Be a Casual Developer
------------------------

As a casual developer, you can dive right in and make fixes... but a project developer will have to check them before they get accepted.

### a) Fork the Repo

Go to the github project page for the project you want to work on and "fork" the project.
This will create a personal version of the project for you.

### b) Clone the Repo

On your computer, run:

    git clone git@github.com:YourUser/ProjectName.git
    
### c) Make Changes

### d) Commit, Push and Pull Request
