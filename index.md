So, you're interested in contributing to Skule code? Awesome! Here's how to get started... 


0) Pick a Project
-----------------
A list of projects is available on the [skule github page](http://github.com/skule/).


1) Install Git
--------------

What's git? It's the most awesome [version control system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control) ever. 
If you don't have git installed, head on over to [here](http://git-scm.com/download) and grab one of the binaries. 
(If you're on Windows choose the Cygwin version)

Never used Git or a version control system before? 
Give [GitRef](http://gitref.org/) and/or [Git for the Lazy](http://www.spheredev.org/wiki/Git_for_the_lazy) a read.


2) Create a GitHub Account
--------------------------

Head on over to [GitHub](http://github.com/) and create an account.

Make sure you config your git afterwards:

    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "email.you.signed.up.to.github.with@example.com"

3) Choose Your Style
--------------------
There are two ways to contribute: being a [casual developer](casual-development.html) or a [trusted developer](trusted-development.html). Both will let you contribute code: it's mostly a question of commitment and trust.

As a [casual developer](casual-development.html), you can dive right in and make fixes... but a trusted developer will have to check them before they get accepted.

[Trusted developers](trusted-development.html) have direct access to the skule github repo, and can also deploy to the production server.
